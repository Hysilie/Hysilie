Hello, I’m Marion. A french learner. 👩🏻

I am interested in web developpement. I am at the first level of my learning. I have for objective to discover some web language and get a specialization of one or two of them with time. 

I started to learn with much interest in february 2022. I am actually working in a totally other domain so I use my free time to learn step by step some web things.

💪🏻 I hope to start an intensive formation in early september 2022.



                > 💻  I’m currently learning JS <

- I followed OpenclassRooms free lessons for begginers (HTML, CSS, JS)
- I followed From Scractch's videos on Youtube to practice
- I'm starting the "JavaScript 30" to get better with vanilla JS


> You'll find some of my pratices on my Github. If you want to look at it, I have to advert you : you'll find some mistakes. Because I try to practice every "concept" I learn.
