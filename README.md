<h2>Hello, I'm <b>Marion</b> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" alt="Hello" width="40" height="40" /></h2>

<h3>👩‍💻 About me</h3>

<p>I'm a front-end web & mobile developer from France 🇫🇷. I started coding in 2022 and since then, I've been diving into the world of UI, UX and clean, purposeful development. I enjoy building useful products, solving real problems, and thinking through both logic and design. It's all in the details!
<br />I worked for 2 years at <b>Sirup Lab</b>, where I contributed to several web and mobile applications built with React and React Native. I'm now looking for a new adventure — open to full-time roles, ideally with impact or creative freedom.</p>

<p>🧡 I love animals and built <b>Animigard</b> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfJHTR1AFbA&ab_channel=MarionLalonde" target="_blank">🔗</a> on my own during my certification. It’s a fullstack mobile app that helps families co-manage their pets’ health and daily care through shared profiles and records.</p>
<p>🧘 I also created <b>Antidepressant</b>, a personal pocket app developed with Electron. It blends journaling, music, and to-do list in a compact format. I use it as a lab for experimenting with Tiptap, local caching, audio features, and a thoughtful use of AI — not as a shortcut, but as a way to challenge and refine my decisions.</p>

<p>🌱 I enjoy learning about UI/UX, accessibility, and software organization. I’m also curious about 3D and creative crafts in my free time.</p>
